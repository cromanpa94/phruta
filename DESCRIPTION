Description: The phruta R package is designed to simplify the basic 
            phylogenetic pipeline. Specifically, all code is run within 
            the same program and data from intermediate steps are saved in 
            independent folders. Furthrmore, all code is run within the 
            same environment which increases the reproducibility of your analysis. 
            phruta retrieves gene sequences, combines newly downloaded and local 
            gene sequences, and performs sequence alignments.

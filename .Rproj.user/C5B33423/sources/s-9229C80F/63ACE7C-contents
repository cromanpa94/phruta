Package: phruta
Type: Package
Title: Phylogenetic Reconstruction and Time-dating
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Cristian Roman-Palacios
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: The phruta R package is designed to simplify the basic phylogenetic pipeline. 
        Furthermore, the fact that all the intermediate steps are saved in independent folder 
        and all the code is run within the same environment increases reproducibility. 
        phruta retrieves gene sequences, combines newly downloaded and local gene sequences, 
        and perform sequence alignment.    phruta is also able to perform basic phylogenetic inference under RaXML 
        on the resulting sequence alignments. The current release allows users to conduct 
        tree dating based on secondary calibrations. phruta is essentially a wrapper 
        for different R packages and additional software.
